      		<h4>About</h4>
      		<p>
      			Welcome to my personal website! My name is Nathan Marianovsky, currently a Ph.D candidate at UCSC working with Richard Montgomery on billiard dynamics. Having graduated from the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering with a BSc in math alongside a minor in applied physics I gravitated strongly towards mathematical physics during my graduate years but have a broad range of interests such as differential geometry, graph theory, differential topology, algebraic topology, Lie groups, quantum mechanics, symplectic geometry, etc... 
      			<br><br>
      			Over the years I have been working on a broad of projects and as such have designed this website to serve the mere purpose of being a central location to showcase everything. In combination to my coding projects I also provide links to where all of my notes written for recitations/sections and lectures over the years can be found. I open-source all of my code and allow for the free sharing of all of my material with the exception that it not be utilized for profiting.
